          <h2>Background Information on COVID-19</h2>
          <p>COVID-19, short for Coronavirus Disease 2019, is an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. 
            The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, and it has since evolved into a global pandemic, significantly 
            impacting the world's health, economy, and daily life. </p>
          <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, 
            leading to widespread global measures to contain the virus. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide grew rapidly, 
            with many countries struggling to contain the spread of the virus. </p>
          <p>Tragically, the pandemic led to a substantial loss of lives. Many people, including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions,
            were particularly vulnerable to severe illness and mortality. The impact of COVID-19 on mortality rates varied from country to country, depending on factors 
            like healthcare infrastructure, public health measures, and vaccination rates. </p>

              <h2>Exploring the Number of Positive Cases For Each Continent</h2>
              <p>From the stacked bar chart on the right, we can observe that Europe had the most number of total positive cases among all the continents, while Oceania
                  had the fewest number of total positive cases among all the continents. 
              </p>
              <p>Additionally, we can also observe that for the continent Northern America, the country USA had the largest number of cases at 81839052, and this was 
                  responsible for the majority of positive COVID-19 cases in Northern America. 
              </p>
              <p>Moreover, it is evident that several countries, including India, Brazil, Germany, France, the UK, and Russia, experienced a large number of COVID-19 cases. 
                  This had a significant effect on their respective continents, leading to a higher overall count of COVID-19 cases.

          <h2>Relationship Between Population & Number of Deaths</h2>
          <p>There is a positive correlation between the population of a country and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in that country. This is because we can see that
            the number of deaths is higher in countries with higher populations. 
          </p>
          <p>We can observe that Europe has the largest number of overall deaths per 1 million of population, and while Latin America and the Caribbean did not have the 
            largest number of overall deaths per 1 million of population, Peru had 6286 deaths per 1 million of population which was a significant outlier from the rest of 
            the continent. 
          </p>
          <p>Lastly, we also can see that Oceania had the fewest number of overall deaths per 1 million of population.

          <h2>Correlation Between Deaths and Positive COVID-19 Cases</h2>
          <p>Generally, we can observe that for countries with smaller populations, the number of deaths is also fewer, and the death rates of these countries are relatively low.
            Similarly, we can also observe that for countries with larger populations, the number of deaths is higher, and the death rates of these countries are relatively high. 
          </p>
          <p>Additionally, from the bubble chart, we can see that for countries with larger total number of positive COVID-19 cases, the number of deaths is significantly higher,
            which means that the number of positive COVID-19 cases in a country has a positive correlation to the number of deaths related to COVID-19 in a country.
